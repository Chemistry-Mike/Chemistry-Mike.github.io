Worked with students through collaboration from the faculty (Professor Siebert) to provide supplemental support for the Organic Chemistry course.

Conducted regular sessions throughout the week ranging from group to singular interactions and held pre-examination testing sessions before each exam, personally crafting practice tests to supplement the education.
