Provided supplementary instruction and support for students enrolled in the introductory **Calculus and Statistics** courses.

Responsibilities included conducting weekly problem-solving sessions, grading assignments, and working one-on-one with students to reinforce core mathematical and statistical concepts essential for scientific and pharmaceutical studies. I worked under the supervision of **Doc. Jurjen Duintjer Tebbens**.
