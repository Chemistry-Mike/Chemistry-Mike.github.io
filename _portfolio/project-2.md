## Project Goal: Decoding Dynamics of Proline-Rich Domains (PRDs)

This research project applies advanced **computational chemistry** and **biophysical modeling** to investigate the structural and functional dynamics of highly flexible **Proline-Rich Domains (PRDs)**, which are crucial components of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) involved in major diseases.

The primary focus is on two critical systems:

---

### 1. P53 Proline-Rich Domain (PRD)

The p53 PRD acts as a regulatory hub for the p53 tumor suppressor. The work focuses on accurately modeling its disordered nature and understanding how its high proline content dictates structure[cite: 938, 940].

* **Structural Fingerprint:** We demonstrated that the p53 PRD exists as a highly flexible, predominantly disordered ensemble that is consistently enriched in **transient Polyproline II (PPII) helices**, interspersed with $\beta$-bends and turns.
* **Contextual Modeling:** By modeling the PRD as an **Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR)**—by restraining the termini to mimic its connection to other globular domains—we showed that this *PPII-based secondary structure fingerprint* remains robust and largely unaffected by environmental constraints. This suggests the PRD acts as a **dynamic hinge**.
* **Mutational Impact:** Analysis of clinically relevant variants (P72R and P82L) provided a molecular basis for their functional consequences, showing how the loss of consecutive prolines (P72R) increases local flexibility, while disruption of a PXXP motif (P82L) eliminates an associated PPII helix.

### 2. Tau Proline-Rich Region (PRR) in Alzheimer's Disease

This work characterized the Tau PRR fragment (Tau(210-240)) and its interaction with the **SH3 domain of BIN1**, a critical genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

* **Hyperphosphorylation Effects:** We used extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and MMGBSA calculations to quantify the precise impact of **hyperphosphorylation** (at T212, T217, T231, and S235) on the Tau-BIN1 interaction.
* **Mechanism of Destabilization:** The addition of phosphate groups causes the Tau peptide to become more compact and disrupts transient secondary structures, which ultimately **destabilizes the complex**. The largest impact was a significant **diminution of salt-bridges** (e.g., R221-D537) and an electrostatic repulsion that shifts Tau's binding preference away from the RT-Src loop toward the more positively charged distal and n-Src loops of BIN1/SH3.
* **Therapeutic Insight:** These detailed structural insights propose a path forward for **targeted therapeutic strategies** focusing on modulating the key electrostatic interactions, rather than just the hydrophobic core interactions, to prevent the detrimental Tau-BIN1 pathology.
