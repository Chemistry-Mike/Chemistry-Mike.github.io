## Project Overview

This research utilized extensive **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations** to explore the conformational landscapes of all four intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within the human tumor suppressor protein p53: **TAD1** (transactivation domain 1), **PRD** (proline-rich domain), **PTL** (pre-tetramerization loop), and **REG** (regulatory domain). The study revealed how local sequence features, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and physical constraints imposed by adjacent globular domains dictate the dynamic behavior essential for p53's function.

## I. TAD1: Transactivation Domain 1 (M1‚ÄìE28) üéØ

TAD1 is the primary interaction site for **MDM2**, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation.

* **Phosphorylation as a Molecular Switch:** Double phosphorylation at **pS15 and pT18** forces the TAD1 domain into a more **compact state**.
* **Inhibition Mechanism:** This compaction stabilizes a **long-range $\beta$-sheet structure** (V10-W23). This structure actively **blocks the key hydrophobic residues** (F19, W23, L26) required for MDM2 binding, thereby preventing the formation of the necessary binding $\alpha$-helix.
* **Reduced Binding Affinity:** Double phosphorylation decreased the calculated binding affinity ($\Delta G_{binding}$) to MDM2 from $-36.4\ \text{kcal}/\text{mol}$ (apo) to **$-22.9\ \text{kcal}/\text{mol}$** (phosphorylated).
* **Methodology Insight:** The **AMBER99SB-DISP** force field proved most accurate for modeling this dynamic region, showing the best agreement with experimental NMR chemical shift data.

## II. PRD: Proline-Rich Domain (Residues 64‚Äì92) üß¨

The PRD acts as a critical linker domain, characterized by high proline content and **PXXP motifs** involved in $\text{SH3}$ domain binding and apoptotic signaling.

* **Wild-Type Structure:** The unbound PRD ensemble is predominantly composed of **unordered structure (45.1%)** and transient **polyproline II (PPII) helices (31.1%)**. The high proline content imposes local rigidity, restricting backbone motion.
* **Structural Robustness (IDR vs. IDP):** Restraining the termini to mimic the physiological context (IDR model) greatly **improved agreement with experimental SAXS data** ($\chi^{2}=0.056$ at $\mathbf{R_{ee}} = 51.2\ \text{√Ö}$). Crucially, the domain‚Äôs fundamental PPII secondary structure profile **remained largely unaffected** by the physical constraint.
* **Mutational Impact:**
    * **P72R:** This common polymorphism disrupts a consecutive proline pair (P71-P72), increasing **local conformational flexibility**.
    * **P82L:** This mutation abolishes a conserved PXXP motif, eliminating the associated PPII helix and interfering with the **PIN1-dependent cis-trans isomerisation** required for Ser20 phosphorylation and p53 activation.

## III. PTL: Pre-Tetramerization Loop (Residues 281‚Äì325) üîó

The PTL connects the DBD and TET domains, and its flexibility is essential for p53's oligomerization.

* **Role of Terminal Restraint:** Simulating the PTL with a **restrained end-to-end distance ($\mathbf{EE_{dist}}$)** corresponding to the observed monomeric structure ($\mathbf{3.0\ \text{nm}}$) significantly **increased the agreement** of predicted NMR chemical shifts with experimental data for backbone carbons.
* **Conformational Changes:** The MD study found that increasing the $EE_{dist}$ shifts the conformational ensemble:
    * $EE_{dist}$ increase leads to an increase in **random coils and PPII helices**.
    * $EE_{dist}$ increase leads to a decrease in $\alpha$-helices, bends, turns, and $\beta$-structures.
* **Local Interactions:** In the contracted state ($EE_{dist}=0.5\ \text{nm}$), interactions are generally between distant residues, but they become more **local and terminal** as the PTL is expanded.

## IV. REG: Regulatory Domain (Residues 350‚Äì393) ‚öñÔ∏è

The C-terminal REG contains multiple phosphorylation sites that stabilize the active p53 tetramer.

* **Effect of Phosphorylation Level:**
    * **Single phosphorylation ($\mathbf{REG_{SP}}$ at S392):** This state closely resembles the **tetrameric (active) form**. It introduced stabilizing **salt bridges** between distant residues, such as $R_{363}$ and $K_{381}$.
    * **Multisite phosphorylation ($\mathbf{REG_{FP}}$):** This state significantly **decreased the domain size**, resembling the **monomeric (dysfunctional) form**. The long-range salt bridges were discouraged, replaced by less dynamic **local interactions**.
* **Structural Disruption:** Multisite phosphorylation significantly destabilized traditional secondary structures, increasing **random coil formation** and hindering beneficial conformational states observed in the $\text{REG}_{SP}$ simulation.
