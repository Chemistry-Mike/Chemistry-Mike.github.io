## Project Goal: Investigating DNA Binding Domains for Targeted Therapeutics

This research project aims to computationally and structurally investigate the **DNA-binding domains (DBDs)** of critical nuclear receptors and transcription factors.

The primary focus is to:

1.  **Investigate the Interface:** Characterize the molecular interface between DNA and specific nuclear receptors, such as the **NR2F family (e.g., NR2F1, NR2F2)**, or the tumor suppressor **p53**. This involves understanding the precise residues and structural motifs responsible for sequence-specific binding and regulation.
2.  **Identify Targetable Cavities:** Utilize advanced simulation and docking techniques to identify and characterize cryptic or allosteric **binding cavities** within these protein-DNA complexes.
3.  **Targeted Drug Development:** Develop **targeted drug development strategies** focused on identifying or designing small molecules that can fit into these identified cavities to modulate (enhance or disrupt) the receptor's DNA binding activity. This is a crucial step towards creating novel therapeutics for diseases driven by nuclear receptor dysfunction or p53 mutation.

## Project Collaborators

<div style="overflow: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;"> <img src="{{ '/images/profile-petr-pavek.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Petr Pavek, Ph.D." style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; width: 200px; height: auto; border-radius: 50%;"> <p><b>Prof. Pavek</b> is a critical experimental collaborator based at the **Charles University Faculty of Pharmacy**. His expertise in **Nuclear Receptor (NR) pharmacology** is essential for validating the functional impact of our computational predictions. While our work focuses on the **DNA-binding domains (DBDs)** and the molecular interface, Prof. Pavek's lab provides the crucial **biological context** and **experimental validation** necessary to translate our structural findings into therapeutic potential. His team uses **cell-based systems**, including **reporter gene assays** and **qPCR**, to experimentally confirm how small molecules or targeted mutations—identified through our simulations—modulate the **transcriptional activity** and **DNA binding specificity** of the targeted nuclear receptors (e.g., NR2F family) or the p53 protein. This collaboration ensures our identified targetable cavities are functionally relevant for drug development.</p> </div>
