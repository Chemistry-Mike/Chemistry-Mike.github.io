## Project Goal: Investigating DNA Binding Domains for Targeted Therapeutics

This research project aims to computationally and structurally investigate the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of critical nuclear receptors and transcription factors.

The primary focus is to:

1.  Investigate the Interface: Characterize the molecular interface between DNA and specific nuclear receptors, such as the NR2F family (e.g., NR2F1, NR2F2), or the tumor suppressor p53. This involves understanding the precise residues and structural motifs responsible for sequence-specific binding and regulation.

2.  Identify Targetable Cavities: Utilize advanced simulation and docking techniques to identify and characterize cryptic or allosteric binding cavities within these protein-DNA complexes.
3.  Targeted Drug Development: Develop targeted drug development strategies focused on identifying or designing small molecules that can fit into these identified cavities to modulate (enhance or disrupt) the receptor's DNA binding activity. This is a crucial step towards creating novel therapeutics for diseases driven by nuclear receptor dysfunction or p53 mutation.

His expertise in Nuclear Receptor (NR) pharmacology is essential for validating our computational predictions on DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Prof. Pavek's lab provides crucial experimental validation using cell-based systems, including reporter gene assays and qPCR. His team confirms how compounds identified through our simulations modulate the transcriptional activity and DNA binding specificity of targeted nuclear receptors or the p53 protein, ensuring our findings are functionally relevant for drug development.</p> </div>
