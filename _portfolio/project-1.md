## Project Goal: Investigating DNA Binding Domains for Targeted Therapeutics

This research project aims to computationally and structurally investigate the **DNA-binding domains (DBDs)** of critical nuclear receptors and transcription factors.

The primary focus is to:

1.  **Investigate the Interface:** Characterize the molecular interface between DNA and specific nuclear receptors, such as the **NR2F family (e.g., NR2F1, NR2F2)**, or the tumor suppressor **p53**. This involves understanding the precise residues and structural motifs responsible for sequence-specific binding and regulation.
2.  **Identify Targetable Cavities:** Utilize advanced simulation and docking techniques to identify and characterize cryptic or allosteric **binding cavities** within these protein-DNA complexes.
3.  **Targeted Drug Development:** Develop **targeted drug development strategies** focused on identifying or designing small molecules that can fit into these identified cavities to modulate (enhance or disrupt) the receptor's DNA binding activity. This is a crucial step towards creating novel therapeutics for diseases driven by nuclear receptor dysfunction or p53 mutation.
