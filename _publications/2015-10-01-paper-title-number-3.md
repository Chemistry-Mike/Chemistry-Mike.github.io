The pre-tetramerization loop (PTL) of p53 is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) necessary for the tetramerization process, but its flexibility makes it challenging to study through traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By restraining the end-to-end distance (EEdist) in simulations to match experimental measurements, the study was able to observe a wider range of secondary structures and contacts, providing new insights into the conformational dynamics of p53 and IDRs in general. These findings have potential implications for understanding how mutations can affect the function of p53.
