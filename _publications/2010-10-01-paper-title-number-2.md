We have developed a method for creating 3D printed models of NMR data. This involves converting FT NMR data into a 3D graph using Mathematica, and then printing it using a 3D printer. These physical models can be used as a teaching tool to help students understand the complex information presented in two-dimensional and relaxation NMR spectra.
