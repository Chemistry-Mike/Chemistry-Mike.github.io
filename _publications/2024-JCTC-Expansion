**Abstract:** The pre-tetramerization loop (PTL) of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) necessary for the tetramerization process, and its flexibility contributes to the essential conformational changes needed. Although the IDR can be accurately simulated in the traditional manner of molecular dynamics (MD) with the end-to-end distance (EEdist) unhindered, we sought to explore the effects of restraining the EEdist to the values predicted by electron microscopy (EM) and other distances. Simulating the PTL trajectory with a restrained EEdist , we found an increased agreement of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts with experiments. Additionally, we observed a plethora of secondary structures and contacts that only appear when the trajectory is restrained. Our findings expand the understanding of the tetramerization of p53 and provide insight into how mutations could make the protein impotent. In particular, our findings demonstrate the importance of restraining the EEdist in studying IDRs and how their conformations change under different conditions. Our results provide a better understanding of the PTL and the conformational dynamics of IDRs in general, which are useful for further studies regarding mutations and their effects on the activity of p53.
