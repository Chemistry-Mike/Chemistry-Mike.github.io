We have developed a method for creating 3D printed models of NMR data. This involves converting FT NMR data into a 3D graph using Mathematica, and then printing it using a 3D printer. These physical models can be used as a teaching tool to help students understand the complex information presented in two-dimensional and relaxation NMR spectra.

**Abstract:** Visualization of two-dimensional and relaxation NMR spectra can be difficult for students new to the subject. Educators have utilized 3D printing previously to demonstrate concepts such as potential energy surfaces and molecular orbitals, but this technology has yet to be used to create a visual model of NMR data. In order to address this, we have developed an approach for creating 3D printed models of two-dimensional and inversion recovery spectra, which can then be used as an innovative teaching tool. This was done by converting raw FT NMR data into a 3D data graph using Mathematica. This graph is then converted into stereolithography format and printed using a 3D printer. These physical models will allow students to better understand the complex information presented in these NMR spectra.
