The p53 protein is also known as the ”Guardian of the Genome” as it can trigger cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Mutations in p53 is quite common in the development of cancer. The protein is also quite complex with multiple domains, and also contains four signficantly disorderd regions.

Our goals in this investigation are to:

1. Investigate the influence of ion concentration on disordered regions in p53.
2. Understand the C-Region’s ability to form tetrameric linkage by pulling two fixed
points of the globular regions of the p53 protein allowing the DBD to bind to the DNA.
3. Investigate the residues’ role in order-disorder transitions in the p53 protein, many of
which specific to the protein’s function.
4. Gain insight into post-translational processes (e.g. phosphorylation) and the
alterations made upon the structure pre- and post- modification.
