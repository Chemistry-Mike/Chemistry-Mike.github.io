I am a scientist working as a PhD researcher at Charles University. My area of expertise is computational chemistry, particularly focused on molecular dynamics and DFT calculations. I am particularly interested in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and the application of machine learning on their molecular dynamics trajectories. My research involves exploring the conformational phase space and generating ideal ensembles to represent these proteins. I have presented my research findings at various conferences and published several papers on the topic. I am passionate about furthering my knowledge in this area and am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other researchers.

Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
======
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are an important area of study and research for scientists due to their unique nature and the potential for a wide range of applications. IDPs are proteins that lack a stable three-dimensional structure and are instead formed by a large number of conformers in equilibrium. This makes them difficult to study using traditional methods such as crystallography or NMR. However, advances in computational methods have enabled researchers to study IDPs using molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations allow for the calculation of chemical shifts from these proteins, which can be used to derive their structure and investigate their properties. This has opened up new opportunities for the study of IDPs, from their structure and function to their interactions with other molecules. The potential applications of this research are vast and include the development of new therapeutic treatments, drug delivery systems, and materials.

Computing NMR Chemical Shifts
------

Calculating the chemical shifts of IDPs can be of great interest to researchers due to its potential applications. Chemical shifts can provide valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of IDPs, which can be used to further our understanding of their behavior and interactions with other molecules. This can be used to develop new therapeutic treatments, drug delivery systems, and materials. Additionally, chemical shifts can be used to study the conformational phase space of IDPs, which can lead to a better understanding of their function and behavior.

Currently, the most common method for calculating NMR chemical shifts from IDPs is through molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations allow for the calculation of the conformations of the protein in order to generate an average chemical shift for each residue. This average can then be used to infer the structure of the IDP. There are several software packages available for this purpose, such as Sparta+, ShiftX, and AMBER, that excel in different areas but all have their limitations. For example, Sparta+ is capable of efficiently calculating chemical shifts but is limited in its accuracy, while ShiftX can provide more accurate results but is less efficient. It is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each software in order to select the best one for the task at hand.

Machine Learning Investigations
------
Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for data analysis and can be used to gain insights into complex systems. These algorithms can be used to uncover patterns and trends in data, as well as to make predictions and decisions. Popular algorithms include dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and singular value decomposition, and clustering algorithms, such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. These algorithms can be used to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories, allowing researchers to explore the conformational phase space of IDPs and to generate ideal ensembles representing these proteins.


Machine learning algorithms can be applied to the analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories of IDPs in order to gain insights into their structure, dynamics, and interactions with other molecules. Dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis and singular value decomposition, can be used to highlight the most important features of the trajectories, allowing researchers to uncover patterns and trends. Clustering algorithms, such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, can be used to investigate the behavior and specific features of the trajectories. Finally, the workflow can be used to generate ideal ensembles that represent the conformational phase space of the IDP, which can be used in future higher-level computations.

Ab-Initio Calculations for Chemical Shifts - A Multi-Scale Approach
------

This investigation extended the multi-scale computational scheme used to calculate Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts (CSs) in proteins that lack a well-defined 3D structure. The scheme employed classical molecular dynamics (MD) with protein fragmentation using the adjustable density matrix assembler (ADMA) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A partial re-optimization was then implemented on the raw MD geometries to enhance the accuracy of the scheme and machine-learning based cluster analysis was used to explore its potential in producing protein structure ensembles (CLUSTER ensembles) that yield accurate CSs at a reduced computational cost. The performance of the cluster-based calculations was validated against results obtained with conventional structural ensembles consisting of MD snapshots extracted from the MD trajectory at regular time intervals (REGULAR ensembles). The partial geometry optimization did not universally improve the agreement of computed CSs with the experiment, but it substantially decreased errors associated with the ensemble averaging. A CLUSTER ensemble with 50 structures yielded ensemble averages close to those obtained with a REGULAR ensemble consisting of 500 MD frames, thus requiring only a fraction of the computational time. 

This procedure allows us to calculate NMR chemical shifts using a multi-scale computational scheme that couples the sampling of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) with protein fragmentation using the adjustable density matrix assembler (ADMA) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A partial re-optimization is then implemented on the raw MD geometries for enhanced accuracy and machine-learning based cluster analysis is used to explore the potential of producing protein structure ensembles that yield accurate CSs at a reduced computational cost. The results from this investigation show that this procedure is efficient and accurate, allowing us to obtain accurate CSs in a fraction of the computational time.
