For months, I'd been deep in the world of **Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)**. These aren't the neat, rigid structures you see in textbooks; they're dynamic, flexible, and utterly central to life, handling critical tasks like cellular signaling and regulating protein-protein interactions.

Proline is one of the most structurally unique amino acids, and its rigid, five-membered pyrrolidine ring is a major player in protein folding, structure, and function. Yet, visualizing this ring clearly amidst the complex 3D structure of a protein can be surprisingly tricky.

When you look at a protein structure, the proline ring (composed of the N, Cα, Cβ, Cγ, and Cδ atoms) is often just a regular part of the stick model. It can be hard to distinguish it from the backbone or side chains of other residues.

To truly study its conformation—like its famous puckering or its role in cis/trans isomerism—you need a visualization that highlights this critical ring in a dedicated, high-impact way.
