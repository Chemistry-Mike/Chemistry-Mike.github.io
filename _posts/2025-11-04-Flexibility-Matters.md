Tau’s PRR is highly flexible, and phosphorylation introduces localized negative charges that disrupt its affinity for BIN1’s SH3 domain. However, in both experiment (NMR) and simulations (MD), the complex still forms, and the binding pose is not altered.

Our findings help explain how specific phosphate charges alter Tau’s structural preferences, which can inform drug development targeting Tau-BIN1 interactions. In addition, these insights support the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and guide computational modeling of intrinsically disordered proteins in biomedical research.
